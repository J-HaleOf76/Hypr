# Hypr

! WARNING: Hypr is still in early development, expect bugs! Make sure to open an issue if you encounter one though! =)

Hypr is a Linux tiling window manager for Xorg. It's written in XCB with modern C++ and aims to provide easily readable and expandable code.

(Readme is more-or-less wip, I know it's ugly.)
