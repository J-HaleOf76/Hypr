# Contributing

Contributing is very welcome, but please read this before starting.

## How to?
I track everything on GitHub. I know torvalds said it's ass, but I can't be bothered to use anything else.

First off, make sure there is no PR for what you are planning to make.

Second, make double and triple sure that what you want to make is *actually useful*. Please do not open a PR for a typo. Open an issue for such things instead.

That's it for now I guess. Thanks for considering contributing to Hypr!
